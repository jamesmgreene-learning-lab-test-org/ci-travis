Nice work getting this pull request opened!

This pull request adds a `.travis.yml` configuration file. This file is necessary to return a successful build. This configuration file is where we define how we want to build and test the code.

All projects have different needs, ranging from standard unit tests to custom configuration.  Regardless of the definition of "success" for your project, this is the place to define it.

There isn't much in this file right now, but we're going to change that. We'll make a change to configure the build environment.

You might be noticing a few things about this configuration file, like the programming language.


You can trigger Travis CI builds with new commits. To trigger Travis CI, add the below text in place of the `replace me with rvm` placeholder:

```yaml
2.4.1
```

## Step 3: Specify the Ruby version

To get the CI build to succeed, replace the placeholder text and commit the change.
