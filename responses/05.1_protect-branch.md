Now that you've added some validation tests to your CI build, it's time to turn on some branch protections. Protected branches ensure that collaborators cannot make irrevocable changes to specific branches. This also allows you to enable CI required status checks to pass before merging.

    <summary>Why use protected branches?</summary>
    Protected branches allow contributors to create branches and pull requests in your repository, while making sure those changes are throughly vetted before merging. When a repository employs a continuous integration service like Travis CI, branches can be protected based on their build statuses so the review process can be largely <i>automated</i>, giving contributors self-efficacy. Project maintainers also benefit by focusing their attention on gray areas and processes that can't be easily automated.

I've changed the protections for the `master` branch throughout the course so far to help keep you on track. Now, it's time for you to make some changes.

## Step 5: Protect the `master` branch

### :keyboard: Activity: Protect a branch based on the CI build status

1. Navigate to the [**Branches** section of the Settings]({{ repo }}/settings/branches) for this repository.
1. Under **Branch protection rules**, click the **Edit** button next to `master`.
1. Select **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
1. Uncheck **Require branches to be up to date before merging**.
    - _This is automatically checked, and can be a good idea. For this project, we'll uncheck it to reduce the extra commits and builds._
1. Select the **Travis CI - Branch** and **Travis CI - Pull Request** options
1. Click **Save changes**.
1. Return to your pull request and [**Approve the pull request**]({{ url }}/files#submit-review).
